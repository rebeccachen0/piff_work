iPython Notebooks:
  - color_plot: uses Y3 reserved stars catalog to generate plots of residuals by band
  - gaia: first attempts with matching y1_test data with Gaia, magnitude distribution plot
  - gaia_y3: matching with Y3 reserved stars
  - piff_DC2: started looking at output of running Mike's DC2 piff yaml
  - psf_plot: applying size/shape measurements to y1_test, measurement/residual distribution plots
  - y3_gaia_plotting_clean.ipynb: uses code from Mike's run_piff script to compare size/shape measurements using only Gaia matched stars
  - split_catalog.ipynb: for one exposure, does Gaia matching, writes out one catalog file per chip with x, y, ra, dec, sky, mag columns.
  - gaia_match_plots.ipymb: on NERSC, global/homes/r/rcchen/

Other files:
- in_gaia_info.fits: BinTableHDU with a row for every star (running through each exposure with the condition if(all(f==0 for f in flag)) in the order listed in exp\_nums.txt and a single column â€” 1 if it is in Gaia and 0 if it is not (generated by gaia_match_plots)
- exp_nums.txt: lists all exposure numbers
- toFocal.py: downloaded from Mike's GitHub, transforms x, y coordinates to FOV coordinates
- run_exposure.py: tries to run piff for one exposure only
- piff.yaml: example yaml file for piff, used in run_exposure.py
